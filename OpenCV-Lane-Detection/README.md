# Lane Detection using OpenCV

## Description
This project involves detecting lane markings on roads using computer vision techniques.
I use Canny edge detection to identify edges in the image and Hough Lines to detect the lines representing the lanes.
The project is implemented in both image and video formats.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakhartiwari10/CV-Projects.git
   cd CV-Projects/lane-detection
