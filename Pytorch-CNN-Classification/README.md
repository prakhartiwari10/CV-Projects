# PyTorch CNN Classification

## Description
This project involves building and comparing different neural network models for image classification using PyTorch. Two datasets are used: Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10. The project is divided into two notebooks:

1. **Fashion MNIST Classification:** Comparison of three models (linear, non-linear, and CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **CIFAR-10 Classification:** Classification of CIFAR-10 dataset using a CNN model.

## Notebooks

### 1. Fashion MNIST Classification
- **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST from `torchvision`.
- **Models:**
  - **Model V0:** Linear model.
  - **Model V1:** Non-linear model.
  - **Model V2:** CNN model.
- **Tasks:**
  - Compare performance and speed of the three models.
  - Plot confusion matrix for the best model.
  - Save and load the best model.

### 2. CIFAR-10 Classification
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 downloaded manually.
- **Model:** CNN model.
- **Tasks:**
  - Classification of CIFAR-10 images using a CNN.
  - Train and test the model.

## Installation
